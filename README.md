What's for Dinner?
==================

This is a simple web application written in Ruby using

* [Sinatra] (http://sinatrarb.com)
* [DataMapper] (http://datamapper.org)

It stores dinner suggestions provided by the user and provides random suggestions at the user's request.

I'm not hosting or maintaining this application any longer.
